A chatbot is software that simulates human-like conversations with users 
via text messages on chat.
Its key task is to help users by providing answers to their questions. 
Chatbots can chat with multiple users at the same time and provide information within seconds.
Because of that, they are now used on a wide scale to help both businesses and consumers 
communicate with each other on websites and mobile messaging apps.

How do chatbots work?
Chatbots are powered by pre-programmed responses, artificial intelligence, or both. 
Based on the applied mechanism, a chatbot processes a userâ€™s question to 
deliver a matching answer. There are two main types of chatbots, and those types also tell us
 how they communicate. They are rule-based chatbots and AI chatbots.
