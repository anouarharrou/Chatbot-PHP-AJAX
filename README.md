# ChatBot
Chatbot Project using PHP & AJAX.

The goal of this project is to make a Chatbot Application that will communicate with Clients and Help Them Find what they Need.

A chatbot is software that simulates human-like conversations with users via text messages on chat.

Its key task is to help users by providing answers to their questions.

Chatbots can chat with multiple users at the same time and provide information within seconds.
Because of that, they are now used on a wide scale to help both businesses and consumers
communicate with each other on websites and mobile messaging apps.
